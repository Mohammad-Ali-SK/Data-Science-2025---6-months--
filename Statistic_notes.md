## Statistics Roadmap Overview
- This roadmap outlines how to prepare for statistics, covering the entire syllabus for data analysts and data scientists.    
- The playlist will include approximately 30-40 videos and will be entirely in Hindi.     
- This learning path is beneficial for aspiring data analysts, data scientists, and Business Intelligence (BI) developers.    

## Types of Statistics
- Statistics is broadly divided into two main fields: **Descriptive Statistics** and **Inferential Statistics**.   
- Data analysts primarily work with both types of statistics.   

  

| Feature           | Descriptive Statistics                                  | Inferential Statistics                                     |
|:---------------- |:------------------------------------------------------ |:--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Goal**     | Summarize and visualize data                            | Draw conclusions about a population from sample data       |
| **Focus**         | Describing characteristics of the observed data         | Making predictions or inferences about a larger group      |
| **Key Activities**| Calculating measures of central tendency/dispersion, creating charts | Hypothesis testing, estimation, prediction                 |
| **Example Topics**| Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Histograms, Box Plots     | Z-test, T-test, Chi-square, ANOVA, Hypothesis Testing      |
   

## Descriptive Statistics
- **Descriptive Statistics** focuses on summarizing and visualizing data.    
- Key topics include:
    -   **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, Median, and Mode.   
    -   **Measures of Dispersion**: Variance and Standard Deviation.   
    -   **Correlation**: Understanding how one data point relates to another, including Spearman and Pearson correlation, and Covariance.    
- Common visualizations and functions covered are:
    -   **Histograms** and **Probability Density Function (PDF)**.    
    -   **Probability Mass Functions (PMF)** and **Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF)**.   
    -   **Kernel Density Estimator**.   
    -   **Box Plots** (also known as Whisker Plots) are specifically used for finding outliers.    
    -   Other plots like bar graphs and scatter plots are also used, depending on variables and data types.    
- It also covers **Univariate** and **Bivariate analysis** to analyze single or two features and their relationships.

## Inferential Statistics
- **Inferential Statistics** involves drawing conclusions about a population based on sample data through experiments and tests.    
- A crucial topic in inferential statistics is **Hypothesis Testing**.    
    -   It involves defining a **Null Hypothesis** and an **Alternate Hypothesis**.   
    -   This process helps data scientists predict outcomes and make conclusions about population datasets.    
- Examples of statistical tests used in inferential statistics include:
    -   **Z-test** and **T-test**.   
    -   **Chi-square test**.   
    -   **ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance), also known as **F-test**.   
- For instance, a data analyst might use hypothesis testing to determine if a new ATM should be opened in a specific location by analyzing transaction data from nearby ATMs.     

Here is a flowchart illustrating the general process of hypothesis testing:

## Importance of Statistics for Decision Making
- Statistical tools are essential for understanding data and making informed decisions.    
- > **ðŸ’¡ Key Insight:** "Data never lies." If something is present in the data, it will be revealed through these tools.   
- Sufficient data and comprehensive analysis enhance decision-making skills.   

## Related Business Intelligence Tools
- The roadmap also touches upon Business Intelligence (BI) tools like **Power BI** and **Tableau**.   
- These tools are used to find Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and create reports and various visualizations.
