    "## **1. What are Ensemble Methods?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Ensemble methods in machine learning combine **multiple models** (often called **base learners** or **weak learners**) to produce a **stronger predictive model**.\n",
    "Instead of relying on the prediction of a single model, ensembles aggregate predictions from several models to improve **accuracy**, **robustness**, and **generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improve prediction accuracy**\n",
    "* **Reduce overfitting**\n",
    "* **Handle variance and bias** better\n",
    "* **Increase model stability** on unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå **Simple analogy:**\n",
    "If one person makes a decision, it may be biased or wrong. If you gather the opinions of 100 experts and take the majority vote, the final decision is more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Types of Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types you must know: **Bagging**, **Boosting**, and **Stacking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple models (often the same type, e.g., Decision Trees) are trained in **parallel** on **different random subsets** of the training data (created via bootstrapping ‚Äî sampling with replacement).\n",
    "2. Predictions from all models are combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Classification ‚Üí **Majority voting**\n",
    "   * Regression ‚Üí **Averaging**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "Reduce **variance** and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random Forest** (most common bagging method)\n",
    "* Bagged Decision Trees\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Boosting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Models are trained **sequentially**, not in parallel.\n",
    "2. Each new model focuses on the **mistakes** made by the previous one.\n",
    "3. Predictions are combined, often with weights based on model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "Reduce **bias** (and variance) by turning weak learners into strong ones.\n",

    "* **Gradient Boosting**\n",
    "* **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "* **LightGBM**\n",
    "* **CatBoost**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world example:**\n",
    "Fraud detection ‚Äî boosting models excel because they learn to focus on rare, difficult-to-predict fraudulent cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Stacking (Stacked Generalization)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train **different types** of models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) on the same dataset.\n",
    "2. Their predictions are fed into a **meta-model** (e.g., Logistic Regression) that learns how to best combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "Leverage the strengths of different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scikit-learn‚Äôs `StackingClassifier` / `StackingRegressor`\n",

    "## **3. How Ensembles Improve Accuracy & Robustness**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduce variance:** Bagging helps stabilize models that overfit.\n",
    "* **Reduce bias:** Boosting corrects the errors of weak learners.\n",
    "* **Leverage diversity:** Stacking blends models with different strengths.\n",

    "1. Start with a weak learner (e.g., shallow Decision Tree).\n",
